## About The Project

The software will encode FASTA and FASTQ files into a format that uses less bits per data record, thus saving some disk space.

Naturally, it can also decode files encoded in this fashion.

It works on Linux as well as Windows.

Since it's merely a proof-of-concept project written over several hours, the code can be described as spaghetti, disorganized, and not properly documented.
